In this repository, we introduce a new architecture based on a deep learning model for segmenting ischemic strokes in T1 MRI modality.
 For more details, please refer to the README below and ensure that each section is followed completely. Also, ensure that each section is 
completed before proceeding to the next section, as this approach follows a sequential manner.


# ISCHEMIC STROKE

When the blood supply to the brain is obstructed by a cloth, there is insufficient oxygen delivery to brain tissues, resulting in cellular necrosis. 
In healthcare settings, it is imperative to identify and delineate the boundaries of ischemic lesions to facilitate treatment and surgical planning. 
Stroke, also referred to as a cerebrovascular accident, is a prevalent neurological disorder worldwide. Additionally, stroke ranks as the second primary contributor to mortality.
