# RESIDUAL ATTENTION XEPTION NETWROK
In this repository, we introduce a new architecture based on a deep learning model for segmenting ischemic strokes in T1 MRI modality.
 For more details, please refer to the README below and ensure that each section is followed completely. Also, ensure that each section is 
 completed before proceeding to the next section, as this approach follows a sequential manner.


# ISCHEMIC STROKE

When the blood supply to the brain is obstructed by a cloth, there is insufficient oxygen delivery to brain tissues, resulting in cellular necrosis. 
 In healthcare settings, it is imperative to identify and delineate the boundaries of ischemic lesions to facilitate treatment and surgical planning. 
 Stroke, also referred to as a cerebrovascular accident, is a prevalent neurological disorder worldwide. Additionally, stroke ranks as the second primary contributor to mortality. 

# REQUIREMENTS 

 Before starting, please ensure that all the requirements listed below are installed on your local PC or server.
 After downloading this repository, navigate to the main directory and execute the following command in your terminal. (Linux is the preferred operating system for this project.)


```

tensorflow == 2.16.1
keras == 3.3.3 
```

# PIPLINE 

The pipeline of this project is listed in below.

- [ ] Dataset (Download, Explaination of data, Exctraction of information eg. lesion distribution)
- [ ] Spliting_data (Based on the previous extracted information, split the data for cross-validation) 
- [ ] Transmition of data ( Copying and convert 3D MRI to 2D slices)
- [ ] Read and prepare data for training and evaluation ( Read the data based on cross-validation spliting and save it in numpy array)
- [ ] Prepare the model of training (Design the model, model hyperparameters)
- [ ] Train the model 
- [ ] Results for each planes
- [ ] Other satates of art 
- [ ] Applying fusion 
- [ ] Fusion Result
- [ ] The weighted and saved model for using 
- [ ] Docker ( For ease of use, we developed the docker composer to easly use the model)
